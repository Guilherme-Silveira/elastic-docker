# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker

Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.


*The Docker images backing this stack include [X-Pack][xpack] with [paid features][paid-features]
enabled by default (see [How to disable paid features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable them). **The [trial
license][trial-license] is valid for 30 days**. After this license expires, you can continue using the free features
seamlessly, without losing any data.*

## Philosophy

We aim at providing the simplest possible entry into the Elastic stack for anybody who feels like experimenting with
this powerful combo of technologies. This project's default configuration is purposely minimal and unopinionated. It
does not rely on any external dependency or custom automation to get things up and running.

Instead, we believe in good documentation so that you can use this repository as a template, tweak it, and make it _your
own_. [sherifabdlnaby/elastdocker][elastdocker] is one example among others of project that builds upon this idea.

## Requirements

### Host setup

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version **17.05** or newer
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.20.0** or newer
* 1.5 GB of RAM

*:information_source: Especially on Linux, make sure your user has the [required permissions][linux-postinstall] to
interact with the Docker daemon.*

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:

* 5044: Logstash Beats input
* 9600: Logstash monitoring API
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana
* 3002: Enterprise Search
* 8200: APM Server

**:warning: Elasticsearch's [bootstrap checks][booststap-checks] were purposely disabled to facilitate the setup of the
Elastic stack in development environments. For production setups, we recommend users to set up their host according to
the instructions from the Elasticsearch documentation: [Important System Configuration][es-sys-config].**

```

### Docker Desktop


#### macOS

The default configuration of _Docker Desktop for Mac_ allows mounting files from `/Users/`, `/Volume/`, `/private/`,
`/tmp` and `/var/folders` exclusively. Make sure the repository is cloned in one of those locations or follow the
instructions from the [documentation][mac-filesharing] to add more locations.

## Usage

### Version selection

This repository tries to stay aligned with the latest version of the Elastic stack. The `main` branch tracks the current
major version (8.x).

To use a different version of the core Elastic components, simply change the version number inside the `.env` file. If
you are upgrading an existing stack, please carefully read the note in the next section.

**:warning: Always pay attention to the [official upgrade instructions][upgrade] for each individual component before
performing a stack upgrade.**

### Bringing up the stack

Clone this repository onto the Docker host that will run the stack, then start services locally using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by adding the `-d` flag to the above command.

**:warning: You must rebuild the stack images with `docker-compose build` whenever you switch branch or update the
version of an already existing stack.**

If you are starting the stack for the very first time, please read the section below attentively.

### Cleanup

Elasticsearch data is persisted inside a volume by default.

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:

```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```

## Initial setup

### Setting up user authentication

*:information_source: Refer to [How to disable paid features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable authentication.*

The stack is pre-configured with the following **privileged** bootstrap user:

* user: *elastic*
* password: *gui@123*

### Injecting data

Give Kibana about a minute to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by opening <http://localhost:5601> in a web
browser and use the following credentials to log in:

* user: *elastic*
* password: *\<your generated elastic password>*

You can also load the sample data provided by your Kibana installation.


## Configuration

*:information_source: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart individual components after
any configuration change.*

### How to configure Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch configuration is stored in [`elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml`][config-es].

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
elasticsearch:

  environment:
    network.host: _non_loopback_
    cluster.name: my-cluster
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Elasticsearch inside Docker
containers: [Install Elasticsearch with Docker][es-docker].

### How to configure Kibana

The Kibana default configuration is stored in [`kibana/config/kibana.yml`][config-kbn].

It is also possible to map the entire `config` directory instead of a single file.

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Kibana inside Docker
containers: [Install Kibana with Docker][kbn-docker].

### How to configure Logstash

The Logstash configuration is stored in [`logstash/config/logstash.yml`][config-ls].

It is also possible to map the entire `config` directory instead of a single file, however you must be aware that
Logstash will be expecting a [`log4j2.properties`][log4j-props] file for its own logging.

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Logstash inside Docker
containers: [Configuring Logstash for Docker][ls-docker].

### How to configure Enterprise Search

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
ent-search:

  environment:
    - "JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
```

### How to configure APM Server
You can also specify the options you want to override by setting the command section inside the Compose file:

```yml
apm-server:

  command: >
       apm-server -e
         -E apm-server.rum.enabled=true
```

### How to disable paid features

Switch the value of Elasticsearch's `xpack.license.self_generated.type` setting from `trial` to `basic` (see [License
settings][trial-license]).

You can also cancel an ongoing trial before its expiry date — and thus revert to a basic license — either from the
[License Management][license-mngmt] panel of Kibana, or using Elasticsearch's [Licensing APIs][license-apis].

### How to scale out the Elasticsearch cluster

Follow the instructions from the Wiki: [Scaling out Elasticsearch](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/wiki/Elasticsearch-cluster)

## Extensibility

### How to add plugins

To add plugins to any ELK component you have to:

1. Add a `RUN` statement to the corresponding `Dockerfile` (eg. `RUN logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-json`)
1. Add the associated plugin code configuration to the service configuration (eg. Logstash input/output)
1. Rebuild the images using the `docker-compose build` command

### How to enable the provided extensions

A few extensions are available inside the [`extensions`](extensions) directory. These extensions provide features which
are not part of the standard Elastic stack, but can be used to enrich it with extra integrations.

The documentation for these extensions is provided inside each individual subdirectory, on a per-extension basis. Some
of them require manual changes to the default ELK configuration.

## JVM tuning

### How to specify the amount of memory used by a service

By default, both Elasticsearch and Logstash start with [1/4 of the total host
memory](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html#default_heap_size) allocated to
the JVM Heap Size.

The startup scripts for Elasticsearch and Logstash can append extra JVM options from the value of an environment
variable, allowing the user to adjust the amount of memory that can be used by each component:

| Service       | Environment variable |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Elasticsearch | ES_JAVA_OPTS         |
| Logstash      | LS_JAVA_OPTS         |

To accomodate environments where memory is scarce (Docker for Mac has only 2 GB available by default), the Heap Size
allocation is capped by default to 256MB per service in the `docker-compose.yml` file. If you want to override the
default JVM configuration, edit the matching environment variable(s) in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

For example, to increase the maximum JVM Heap Size for Logstash:

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LS_JAVA_OPTS: -Xmx1g -Xms1g
```

### How to enable a remote JMX connection to a service

As for the Java Heap memory (see above), you can specify JVM options to enable JMX and map the JMX port on the Docker
host.

Update the `{ES,LS}_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable with the following content (I've mapped the JMX service on the port
18080, you can change that). Do not forget to update the `-Djava.rmi.server.hostname` option with the IP address of your
Docker host (replace **DOCKER_HOST_IP**):

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LS_JAVA_OPTS: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18080 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=18080 -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=DOCKER_HOST_IP -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false
```
